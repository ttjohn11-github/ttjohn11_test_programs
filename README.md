# ttjohn11_test_programs
This repo contains test programs 
wordcount project contains code and test for counting words in a string

The programs require Java 8
Please refer to unit tests in src/test/java - for usage

The problem statement looks like expecting order of words in the string. so I have used LinkedHashmap

For command line input , please use 
go to project classes directory, for e.g. <<<>>/ttjohn11_test_programs\wordcount\target\classes>
java com.ubs.rec.wordcount.WordCountRunner
